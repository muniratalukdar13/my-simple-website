        <p>This is Munira. Here I would like to share something about myself and my preference. To begin with, I 
            was falling back because of some reasons but I pushed my to change everything just like a 
            fresher. In my opinion, having ups and downs is just like a part of our life. In that situation we 
            need someone who will encourage you to face it or change it. For me, I have my beloved 
            parents who always got my back and support me. must admit that I have less self confidence at 
            the beginning of every single think but I can compare myself to water as I can handle the worst 
            situation without having experience. The one and only reason is that I trust Allah more than 
            myself and I am damn sure that ALLAH IS THE BEST PLANNER.</p>
